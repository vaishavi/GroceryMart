# GroceryMart



## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to address the common
challenge faced by international students in finding the best deals
for various products at grocery stores. With the rising prices of
goods due to inflation, it becomes crucial to save each dollar,
and shopping apps like XYZ often set prices higher than those
at the store. Additionally, such apps are not ideal for shoppers
with a monthly budget, as they incur both delivery and service
fees. Moreover, grocery price-comparison apps are only available
for iOS users, neglecting Android users. To address this issue,
we propose the development of a desktop/mobile-friendly website
that allows users to create grocery lists and displays prices offered
by major grocery stores for the items in their list. Users can also
favorite their preferred items, making it easier to compare prices
and select the best grocery store to visit. This project aims to
provide a cost-effective solution for international students and
others facing similar challenges, thereby saving time and money
